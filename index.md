## About

I'm an Associate Professor of Linguistics at York University, where I teach undergraduate and graduate courses on Language Acquisition, Speech Science, Speech Perception, and Psycholinguistics. My research has a wide scope and includes infant speech perception, infant-directed speech, the interaction between speech and language processing, and phonetic and perceptual approaches to sound change.
